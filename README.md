# Implementation of a Pipelined Multi-Core MIPS Machine

This is a self-study project based on the book [[1]](#1). The goal of this repository is to provide **both VHDL and SystemVerilog implementations** for the gate-level model presented in the book for a pipelined multi-core [MIPS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIPS_architecture) machine.
